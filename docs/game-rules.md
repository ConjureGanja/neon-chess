# Neon Chess: Game Rules & Features

## Introduction

Welcome to Neon Chess, a visually stunning chess variant with multiple game modes, AI opponents, and online multiplayer. This document explains the rules, features, and strategic considerations to help you master the game.

## Game Variants & Rules

### Standard Chess Rules

Neon Chess follows traditional chess rules with these core mechanics:

- Each piece has unique movement patterns:
  - **Pawns**: Move forward one square (or two on first move) and capture diagonally
  - **Knights**: Move in an L-shape (two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular)
  - **Bishops**: Move diagonally any number of squares
  - **Rooks**: Move horizontally or vertically any number of squares
  - **Queens**: Move diagonally, horizontally, or vertically any number of squares
  - **Kings**: Move one square in any direction

- Special moves include:
  - **Castling**: King moves two squares toward a rook, and the rook moves to the square the king crossed
  - **En Passant**: Capture an opponent's pawn that has moved two squares forward, as if it had moved only one
  - **Pawn Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be upgraded to any other piece (usually a queen)

### King Capture vs. Checkmate

Neon Chess offers two victory conditions that can be selected before the game starts:

#### Traditional Checkmate Mode
- The goal is to checkmate your opponent's king (threaten capture with no legal escape)
- If your king is in check, you must make a move that removes the threat
- Stalemate (no legal moves but king not in check) results in a draw
- This is the classical chess endgame condition

#### King Capture Mode (Variant)
- The goal is to actually capture the opponent's king
- Kings can be left in check, and players are not forced to move out of check
- The game continues until a king is captured
- This creates a more aggressive, tactical gameplay style
- Think of this like the ancient game of Shatranj, where decisive captures are prioritized

### Time Controls

Multiple time control options are available:

- **Untimed**: No time limits (casual play)
- **Blitz**: 3-5 minutes per player for the entire game
- **Rapid**: 10-15 minutes per player
- **Classical**: 30+ minutes per player
- **Increment**: Additional seconds added after each move (configurable)

## Strategic Considerations

### Opening Principles

Like traditional chess, strong openings follow these principles:

1. **Control the center** with pawns and pieces
2. **Develop pieces** quickly to active squares
3. **Castle early** to protect your king
4. **Connect your rooks** by clearing the back rank

Popular openings include:
- Italian Game (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4)
- Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5)
- Queen's Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4)
- French Defense (1.e4 e6)

### Middle Game Tactics

Watch for these tactical opportunities:

- **Pins**: Force a piece to stay in place to protect a more valuable piece
- **Forks**: Attack two pieces simultaneously with one piece
- **Skewers**: Attack two pieces in a line, forcing the more valuable piece to move
- **Discovered Attacks**: Move one piece to reveal an attack from another
- **Zwischenzug**: Make an unexpected move in a sequence

### King Capture Mode Tactics

When playing the King Capture variant:

- **Calculated Risks**: Sometimes leaving your king in check is worthwhile to capture the opponent's king first
- **Aggressive Attacks**: Launch direct assaults on the enemy king
- **Sacrifices**: Piece sacrifices that lead to king capture are more valuable
- **Move Order**: The sequence of captures becomes critically important
- **Tempo Plays**: Moves that gain tempo are especially powerful in this mode

### Endgame Techniques

Master these essential endgame skills:

- **King and Pawn Endgames**: Understanding opposition and key squares
- **Rook Endgames**: Creating and advancing passed pawns
- **Queen vs Rook**: Techniques to force win or draw
- **Bishop and Knight Checkmate**: The trickiest basic checkmate
- **Fortress Positions**: Recognizing drawn positions despite material disadvantage
